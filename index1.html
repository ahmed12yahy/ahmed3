          <p>In simple terms, robotics combines science, engineering, and technology to design, construct, operate,
                 and use machines programmed to replicate, substitute, or assist humans in completing tasks of varying complexity.<br>
                  These machines are known as robots. 
                Robots have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece; notably, the first digital-operated and programmable
                robot debuted in the mid-twentieth century. Robotics quickly took over key industries like automotive manufacturing, 
                with early spot welding robot prototypes used in General Motors facilities in 1961. Throughout the years,
